<h2>About this project :</h2>
The idea behind this site was actually what got me started programming. I had this little idea then, and thought i'd give it a shot to see if this could make me some money. Problem was developers were either too expensive or too sketchy to hire. So o gave myself 6 months to TRY to learn to code and develop an app myself. Fast forward 6 months later, i only managed to complete two chapters and gave up soon after. Now i thought it would be a good idea to recreate a Beta version of this idea with my current knowledge and buid from here.

<h2>What it's all about?</h2>
Its about people coming together to help one another with tasks big or small. Maybe you feel generous with your time today or perhaps you feel like giving back to soceity? Or maybe you're just loaded with work or have your weekly life admin piling up and need help getting something done. Come on to the site and search / ask for help from people around you.
